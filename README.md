The dataset that I will use for my project comes from a previously published study that investigates the association between gut microbiota and suicidal behavior in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients.

The major scientific question that I hope to answer is whether gut microbial diversity and community composition are different between patients with MDD who have made a recent suicide attempt and those with MDD who have no history of suicide attempts.

Null Hypothesis: there are no differences in gut microbial diversity and community composition between MDD patients with a recent suicide attempt and those without a history of suicide attempts. 

Alternative Hypothesis: MDD patients with recent suicide attempt will show difference in gut microbial diversity and community composition compared to MDD patients without a history of suicide attempts.
