The dataset that I will use for my project comes from a previously published study that investigates the association between gut microbiota and suicidal behavior in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients.

I have two major scientific questions.
1) Do hospitalized patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who have made a recent suicide attempt exhibit higher gut microbial alpha diversity compared to MDD patients without a history of suicide attempts?
2) Do hospitalized patients with MDD have distinct microbial species in their microbial composition compared to MDD patients without a history of suicide attempts?

Null Hypothesis: there are no differences in gut microbial diversity and community composition between MDD patients with a recent suicide attempt and those without a history of suicide attempts. 

Alternative Hypothesis: MDD patients with recent suicide attempt will show difference in gut microbial diversity and community composition compared to MDD patients without a history of suicide attempts.
