The dataset that I will use for my project comes from a previously published study that investigates the association between gut microbiota and suicidal behavior in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients.

I have two major scientific questions.
1) Do hospitalized patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) who have made a recent suicide attempt exhibit higher gut microbial alpha diversity compared to MDD patients without a history of suicide attempts?
2) Do hospitalized patients with MDD have distinct microbial species in their microbial composition compared to MDD patients without a history of suicide attempts?

Alpha diversity 
Null hypothesis: There is no difference in gut microbial alpha diversity between hospitalized MDD patients with a recent suicide attempt and those without a history of suicide attempts.
Alternative hypothesis:Hospitalized MDD patients with a recent suicide attempt exhibit higher gut microbial alpha diversity compared to MDD patients without a history of suicide attempts.

Beta Diversity 
Null hypothesis: Gut microbial community composition does not differ between hospitalized MDD patients with a recent suicide attempt and those without a history of suicide attempts.
Alternative hypothesis: Hospitalized MDD patients with a recent suicide attempt have distinct microbial species compared to MDD patients without a history of suicide attempt.
